<p>
  This post was inspired from the moment when you are developing and someone 
  shows you or you find a tool that makes your job 100 times easier.  Here are a
  few of those tools I've found lately.
</p>
<h3>Disable Cache in Chrome</h3>
<p>
  Chrome is a crazy caching fiend.  This is one of the reasons it is crazy fast.
  However, when developing, this can be annoying. I accidentally stumbled across
  how to easily disable cache and just about slapped myself in the face because
  it was so easy.  In the developer tools there is a gear at the bottom right.  
  Click that and voila, there's the disable cache option!  See image below.<br/>

<h3>Ripple Emulator</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://ripple.tinyhippos.com/">Ripple</a> is a mobile emulator
  extension for Chrome.  Ripple emulates or supports WebWorks, Mobile Web, and 
  PhoneGap.  I believe HTML is still rendered by Chrome so will still have to 
  test your mobile web site/app on real hardware, but it gives you a great way to
  start testing in your browser.
</p>
<h3>Kendo UI</h3>
<p>
  While jQueryUI is awesome, it kind of sucks in terms of design aesthetic. 
  Currently, Neutron IDE is implemented via jQueryUI.  I set out to find some UI
  framework that would look better.  I was not dead set on a jQuery compatible 
  framework but that would definitely be a plus.  My top choices were 
  <a href="http://www.sencha.com/">Sencha</a>, <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a>, 
  and <a href="http://www.kendoui.com/">Kendo UI</a>.  There are other great 
  frameworks like backbone.js but decided against them because I was more 
  concerned with having a good set of UI widgets, than having more structured
  javascript code.  The UI for Neutron IDE at the end of the day is not
  complicated, except for the editor which is provided by the 
  <a href="http://ace.ajax.org/">Ace Editor Project</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to go with <a href="http://www.kendoui.com/">Kendo UI</a> because it
  looked decent and was jQuery compatible.  Basically, it is a better looking than
  jQueryUI with a few more widgets.  <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a>
  was more about programming in Objective-J which I didn't want to do.  And while
  <a href="http://www.sencha.com/">Sencha</a> was more complete in terms of 
  widgets, it did not look too much better than Kendo UI, so the jQuery
  compatibility gave it the edge.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.kendoui.com/">Kendo UI</a> is fairly new but looks good so
  far.  I'm almost done implementing it in the development branch of Neutron IDE.
  The next release of Neutron IDE will include this change.

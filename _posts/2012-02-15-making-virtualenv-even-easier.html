<p>
  If you develop multiple Python projects at once then 
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">VirtualEnv</a> is an essential
  tool to make managing packages and keeping conflicts at bay. However, typing 
  <br>
  <code>source /some/long/path/name/sucks/bin/activate</code><br>
  to start your virtual environment gets annoying.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, I created <a href="https://github.com/pizzapanther/Python-Quick-Env">Python Quick Env</a>.
  Once installed and setup, typing <code>pyenv project1</code> will start up your
  VirtualEnv and bring you to the project directory.
</p>
<p>
  Now go enjoy an extra 5 seconds of life everytime you start up a VirtualEnv!

  <strong>Update 02/12/2012</strong><br>
  When in a Virtual Env executing <code>pyenv</code> take you back to your
  project home.  Stay tuned for more updates.

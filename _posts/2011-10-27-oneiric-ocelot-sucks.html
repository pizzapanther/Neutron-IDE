title: Oneiric Ocelot Shows Ubuntu's Quality is Declining

<p>
  I've used Ubuntu for several years both at home and at work. I first swithced
  to Ubuntu years earlier when constantly having to do reinstalls of both Windows
  and Linux and noticed how much easier Ubuntu was to use and install.  Back then
  it seemed like with every release of Ubuntu, the distro got better.
</p>
<p>
  Lately, with the past couple of releases, the Ubuntu desktop version's quality
  has declined drastically.  Most of this decline has come because of the
  introduction of Unity. I actually like Unity and think it could take Ubuntu in
  a good direction, but instead it is introducing bad design changes and loads of 
  bugs. Below I go through some of what I think are the bad design changes and, 
  bugs that are annoying me to death.
</p>
<h3>Bad Design</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Disappearing Global Menu: I actually started using the global menu before 
      it was made the default. I liked the whole idea since most screens are
      wide and have less vertical space then horizontal. However, if the menu 
      dissappears, it leaves you searching and waiting for the menu to appear so
      you can find what your looking for. I think the reason for it disappearing
      is to save space, but I have never once run out of space for the menu
      especially since you can no longer add applets to the global bar.
    </li>
    <li>
      Disappearing Window Decorators: When windows are maximized, the close, 
      minimize, and maximize disappear.  Again, you now find yourself waiting for
      buttons to appear.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unity Menu: To find an application to open, you now must make two to three 
      more clicks than just clicking a simple categorized "start menu". Sure you
      can find stuff quicker by doing a text search, but lots of us don't want to
      do a text search. Now Ubuntu almost forces you to do a search because it is
      so hard to find an app by mouse.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unity and Application Configuration: If Ubuntu would just add some
      configuration options, like turning off hiding menus, most of the design
      headaches would go away.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>
  Here is a list of bugs I've run into in version 11.10. A while ago there was a 
  push to fix the &quot;100 paper cuts&quot;. Now I feel like we've been plunged
  into the 1000 paper cuts era.
  <ul>
    <li>
      System Crashes: Several of my Ubuntu machines crash once or more a day 
      where before they were rock solid.
    </li>
    <li>
      Shutdown Fake Out: On one machine whenever I choose to shutdown from the
      login menu or user logout applet, the machine never shutsdown. I can only
      shutdown via the command line.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unity Dock Won't Move: On a dual screen setup I can no longer get Unity on
      the correct screen.  Before I could change the primary screen to move it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Software Fails Installing Third Party DEBs: Installing Chrome and other 
      apps via the software center often fails and thus I have to install via
      command line with dpkg.
    </li>
    <li>And many more ...</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This is in no way a comprehensive list, but just is what is in my brain at this
  moment. A lot of these issues have been in my head for a while and it just seems
  with 11.10 the quality of Ubuntu has declined too far.  Ubuntu is becoming 
  a pain to work with rather than a joy.  Maybe I'm being to harsh on non-LTS
  releases? If so why do I not see more warnings about using non-LTS
  releases from Canonical? I feel like they push them as fully baked when they 
  are not.

<p>
  What is your take on Ubuntu 11.10? Major win or major fail?

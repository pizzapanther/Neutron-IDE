  In <a href="/review/2011/10/27/oneiric-ocelot-sucks.html">previous a post</a> I
  talked about Unity and how much it bites. But what do you do now?  Which 
  distros are a good replacement?  Here are a few good alternatives to the main
  version of Ubuntu. All are based on Ubuntu which shows Ubuntu is still solid; 
  it is just Unity which most of hate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><a href="http://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a></strong><br/>
  Linux Mint 12 comes with MATE which is a GNOME 3 compatible fork of GNOME 2.
  This will give you an interface that you are used too while also giving you access
  to new GNOME 3 libraries. In my experience, I ran into a lot of the Unity bugs.
  I assume that means that Unity is getting a bad reputation not only from itself
  but also bugs in GNOME 3.  So if you used Unity and just hate the interface and
  haven't run into any show stopping bugs, then this is the distro for you. For me
  Linux Mint was just too buggy like Ubuntu 11.10 for everyday use.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a></strong><br/>
  Xubuntu is a lightweight variant of Ubuntu that uses the Xfce desktop 
  environment. While its feature set is less than Linux Mint or Ubuntu, it is 
  stable and fast. Also a lot of features can be added in by simply installing 
  packages from apt. For instance, the Xubuntu default dock sucks in my opinion, 
  so I always install a more featureful dock called 
  <a href="http://wiki.go-docky.com/">Docky</a>. Since I'm a developer I really
  love the speed and stability of Xubuntu and would gladly give away some
  features to get this.

<p>
  <strong><a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a></strong><br/>
  Lubuntu is also a lightweight variant of Ubuntu that uses LXDE. Again while its
  feature set is less than Linux Mint or Ubuntu, it is stable and fast. This has
  been the distro that I've been living with for the past few weeks, and I love
  it. I would say it is even a level faster than Xubuntu. If you have an old 
  computer or netbook, Lubuntu still feels snappy. It has become my default
  distro for renewing old computers and netbooks which for some reason happened 
  a lot with my family around Christmas.

  One problem I ran into, since I like to use Docky, is that Lubuntu has no
  compositing features. This means no 3D or effects can be done with the window
  manager. This can be easily remedied by installing a composition manager. First
  install the package <strong>xcompmgr</strong>. Next we have to make sure the 
  sure the manager auto starts when we log in.  You can do this by adding a file
  named <strong>aaaxcompmgr.desktop</strong> to 
  /home/your_username/.config/autostart/.  The content of the files are below.
  <pre>
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=AComp
Type=Application
Exec=xcompmgr -n
Terminal=false
NoDisplay=false
Categories=Utility;
  </pre>
</p>

  Lastly, another problem I ran into with Xubuntu and Lubuntu, since I use a laptop
  dock, is that the audio output would not switch correctly when docking. The 
  easiest way I found to fix this is just to use the Pulse Audio command line 
  tool, <strong>pacmd</strong>.  I'v tried other GUIs and I always
  end up confused about what to do.  <code>pacmd set-default-sink #</code> is the
  quickest and easiest way I've found to change the audio output.
